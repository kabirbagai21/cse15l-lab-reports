**This is a tutorial for setting up VSCode, connecting to a remote server and running commands.**

**1. Installing VS Code**

Click on this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download VSCode for the appropriate type of operating system. When you've downloaded it sucessfully, the home screen should look something like this:

**2. Remotely Connecting**

Now, we will remotely connect to the ieng6 server in the CS Lab. Each student is issued a course specific account to do so. To find your account, visit: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Once you have your account details (account name and password), 
copy the following command into the command line: 
`$ ssh cs15lwi22ajr@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

*note the account name is unique to me, place your own account name before the `@ieng6.uscd.edu`
